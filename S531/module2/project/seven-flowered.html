            <p class="dream"> Note:This is a poem from a children's fairy tale about 
                a magical flower that could make any wish come true. 
                Seven - petals, seven desires. 6 wishes were useless, the girl 
                made wishes for pleasure: toys, sweets, but there was no pleasure left after.
                And on the last petal she suddenly notices a boy with crutches... 
            </p>

            <p>
                Somewhere there is one flower,<br>
                It has seven petals,<br>
                I wish I could make a wish,<br>
                All your wishes!<br>
                Just tell me, <br>
                Where can I find that flower,<br>
                Where, where is he like this<br>
                My little seven-colors flower!<br>
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Fly, fly petal,<br>
                Through west to east,<br>
                Through the north, through the south,<br>
                Come back after making a circle!<br>
                Fly, fly petal,<br>
                Through west to east,<br>
                Fly around the Earth,<br>
                To be, in my opinion, led!<br>
            </p>
