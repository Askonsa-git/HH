            <h2>Briefly about me</h2> <img src="images/anna.jpg" alt="portrait of Anna">
            <p>I was born in 1985 in a beautiful and picturesque place - the village of Bezrukovo, somewhere far in the
                south of Siberia.</p>

            <p>In school, I studied well and read a lot. However, it wasn't always like that. At the beginning of my
                education, I preferred to spend time outdoors, and I hurried through my lessons, bringing home poor
                grades.
                Then my dad applied a disciplinary approach, stating that I could only go out if my grades were high.So,
                I
                made an effort to do my homework well, which took a lot of time. </p>
            <p>All my friends, after a few unsuccessful attempts to invite me outside, stopped coming to see me. Over
                time, I became engrossed in my studies and
                became one of the best students. Reading books captivated me into the world of imagination.</p>

            <li>At the age of 16, I started living independently: I moved to the city, studied at a pedagogical college,
                and
                worked simultaneously as a nanny.</li>

            <li>At 20, I moved to the huge city of Moscow. In my childhood, I couldn't even dream that I would ever
                visit
                it.</li>

            <li>At 26, I moved to St. Petersburg.</li>

            <li>At 37, I moved to Finland.</li>
            <p> Yes, life is amazing.</p>
