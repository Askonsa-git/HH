            <p>I got acquainted with volleyball at the age of 30 when I started working at the school.
                I met colleagues from other schools who invited me to play traditional volleyball.
                We used to meet once a week on Fridays in the school gym.
                I wasn't doing well at first, but I am persistent.</p>
            <p>I started taking lessons from a coach, and after about six months, things started to improve for me.</p>
            <p> After two years, I stopped playing traditional volleyball and switched to beach volleyball. I like this
                type of volleyball more!</p>
            <p> In beach volleyball, there are only 2 players in a team, whereas in traditional volleyball, there are 6
                players in a team. That's why beach volleyball involves more activity and movement.
            <p>In the summer, we play outdoors, and in the winter, we play indoors.</p>
